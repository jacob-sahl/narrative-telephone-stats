Twas chilled that foggy morning,

as enchanter Pumat wandered the wood in search

of fine mushrooms to flavor his food.

He plucked a fine fungus when a guttural growl

caught his ears.

A feral wolf stalking from the shadows.

To his surprise, the beast did speak.

"'Tis I, the lonely Wildred and you, my meal."

Pumat recoiled, reaching into his pouch of plenty.

"Wandered I am, friend Wildred.

"I fear a poor meal would I make.

"For this humble Pumat is tough on teeth

"and filled with muscle."

The simple fear bulg's bulging form took hold

of the hunter wolf and wrestled powerfully they did

across the trees and brooks until an evening's mushroom stew

took on a unique, lupine flavor.

<ASHLEY>

So.

Twas a great and just beautiful night out in

the woods and

Pumat was just out walking around, his normal nightly stroll

and trying to get some mushrooms.

He came across one that was

poisonous, I think, and...

Yeah, so he's like, you know, picking the mushrooms

and he hears a growl.

And he's like,

"Oh no, oh my gosh, what's out here?"

And then he turns around and it's a

hunter wolf.

'Cause all wolfs aren't hunters, I guess.

But this one in particular is.

And he's like,

"Oh my gosh, I'm scared.

"Go away."

(Ashley laughs)

That's not what he said.

He said,

"Get out of here.

"I have--"

Wait, no, the wolf...

When he saw the wolf, the wolf had a beak.

(Ashley laughs)

That definitely does not sound right.

Anyway, so yeah,

so Pumat was talking back to him and he's like...

(snorts)

(Ashley laughs)

Oh, I'm so sorry.

He's talking back to him and he's like,

"Hey, don't be mean to me.

"Don't you eat me because I'm Pumat Sol and..."

that night Pumat Sol down by the beautiful brook

in the forest area

that he was walking in, he was making food

and this beautiful food that he made, it was a stew

and with all the mushrooms that he made

and it had an interesting lupine taste.

<TALIESIN>

It was a dark, mysterious night in the forest

and Pumat Sol was wandering around collecting mushrooms,

odd mushrooms, poisonous mushrooms, some of them.

Strange mushrooms.

And as he was wandering around at night in the forest,

he was approached by a hunter wolf of some kind.

This wolf had a strange beak on his face.

And Pumat Sol, upon seeing this hunter wolf said,

"Hey now, you leave me alone and don't you eat me.

"You stay away.

"You stay away, you dangerous wolf."

And later that evening, after threatening this wolf,

Pumat Sol had himself a

very, very tasty stew

made with the mushrooms that he had collected

and the stew had an oddly lupine flavor there

in the dark woods by a brook.

<MARISHA>

It was a dark forest

in the middle of the night

in the dead of

winter--

I don't think that's right.

It was in the middle of the night.

And Pumat Sol was wandering through the forest

collecting mushrooms for a stew.

And suddenly,

he encroached upon a

hunter wolf with a beak.

So I don't know what that is.

Hunter wolf with a beak and

the wolf was

threatening him and Pumat Sol said,

"Hey you, don't you threaten me.

"That's not very nice."

And

then went on his merry way and later, by a wonderful stream

he made a nice stew with the mushrooms.

But this mushroom stew had an oddly lupine taste to it.

So,

we're watching you, Pumat Sol.

<SAM>

One night, it was a dark and

it's very important that it was a dark night.

Marisha was very emphatic about that.

And I believe it was winter.

Cold, snow on the ground

in a desolate forest.

Pumat Sol, our beloved friend, Pumat Sol was

just wandering about the forest at night

on a winter's night, as you do.

And he came upon--

oh shit.

Oh, he came upon a wolf who was just minding

his own business and Pumat Sol stumbled upon him and

frightened the wolf.

And the wolf became ill-tempered.

And it turns out that the wolf was

a hunter of some sort.

Maybe a disguise.

And Pumat Sol said,

"Oh, hey there, buddy.

"I don't want to make any trouble.

"I'm just out collecting...

"Collecting.

"Hunting for things."

What was he doing?

I've forgotten.

Anyway,

"Oh, don't worry about me, I'm innocent."

The wolf said,

"Eh, don't worry about it, keep going.

"Forget it ever happened."

Then--

oh, he was collecting mushrooms.

Pumat was collecting mushrooms and so he had

a bunch of mushrooms.

And I think the wolf looked up and down at the mushrooms

but sorta let it go.

Then later, when Pumat Sol got out of the forest,

he looked at the mushrooms and was very taken by them.

They were very curious mushrooms.

He decided to eat them.

And when he did, they had a very lupine flavor to them

and they changed things in Pumat Sol.

He became...

Well, something more.

<LAURA>

It was a dark and cold

wintery night and

Pumat Sol was walking through the forest and

he was searching for mushrooms.

And he went and he found some and then

as he was

kept hunting for more mushrooms, he came upon a wolf.

And the wolf was like,

really angry that

Pumat met him and

then he was like,

"I'm just a hunter.

"I don't--

"You're fine, just keep going."

And Pumat Sol was like,

"Okay,"

and...

Yeah, and then Pumat Sol left and he

ate the mushrooms and

they had a very lupine flavor?

And,

Pumat Sol became something more.

<TRAVIS>

It was a dark and

cold winter's evening

when Pumat Sol was walking through a forest.

As Pumat Sol walked through that cold, dark, wintery forest,

he came upon a wolf.

Wait.

First, Pumat Sol was looking for some mushrooms.

But then he came upon a wolf.

And the wolf came up and was angry to see Pumat Sol.

But the wolf was like,

"Hey, no bigs.

"I'm a hunter."

And Pumat Sol was like,

"Okay, sorry I ran into you."

And then the wolf left?

And then Pumat Sol continued his quest

to try and find some mushrooms.

And he found them.

And when he found them, they had a very

lupine flavor?

They tasted like a wolf.

And believe it or not, that's it.

<LIAM>

It was a dark

and scary night.

And cold.

And Pumat Sol was wandering through the forest.

(sniffs)

That was a signature Travis Willingham CEO sniff.

And he was alone in that dark, cold,

snowy now forest when he ran into a wolf

that he wasn't expecting.

And the wolf said,

"Hey."

And Pumat said,

"Hey, what are you doing here?"

And oh, but first, Pumat was here looking for shrooms.

And the wolf said,

"Hey, no bigs, my man.

"I'm a hunter."

And Pumat said,

"Okay."

And,

something happened.

I guess they parted ways.

But first, the wolf said,

"Here, try these mushrooms."

Maybe he was looking for them, maybe it was the wolf's idea.

I can't remember.

And then Pumat

sniffed the mushrooms and they were wolf-scented.

Like they sometimes are.

And that's the end of the story.

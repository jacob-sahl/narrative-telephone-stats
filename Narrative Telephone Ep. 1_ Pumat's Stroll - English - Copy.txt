Oh my God, okay.

Here goes.

Here's the story.

I already forget everything.

My wife did an interesting job.

I have no pressure, bring it on.

(playful music)

Hello everyone.

During these weird times, the cast of Critical Role

has decided to entertain themselves and hopefully you

in the process by playing a game that we are now

referring to as Narrative Telephone.

Yeah, you remember that game Telephone

that we used to play as kids?

It's that but with a CR twist.

Here's how it's gonna work.

Dungeon Master Matt Mercer will record himself

telling a short story.

He will then take that video and send it off

to the next person who is only allowed to watch it once.

We have Producer Max as witness, ensuring this fact.

That person must then record themselves

recounting the story to the best of their memory.

They will then take their version and send it off

to the next cast member who will repeat the process

and so on and so forth.

The final recounting is sure to be

quite a cluster.

So, without further ado, let us tell you a story.

Twas chilled that foggy morning,

as enchanted Pumat wandered the wood in search

of fine mushrooms to flavor his food.

He plucked a fine fungus when a guttural growl

caught his ears.

A feral wolf stalking from the shadows.

To his surprise, the beast did speak.

"'Tis I, the lonely Wildred and you, my meal."

Pumat recoiled, reaching into his pouch of plenty.

"Wandered I am, friend Wildred.

"I fear a poor meal would I make.

"For this humble Pumat is tough on teeth

"and filled with muscle."

The simple fear bulg's bulging form took hold

of the hunter wolf and wrestled powerfully they did

across the trees and brooks until an evening's mushroom stew

took on a unique, lupine flavor.

(playful music)

So.

Twas a great and just beautiful night out in

the woods and

Pumat was just out walking around, his normal nightly stroll

and trying to get some mushrooms.

He came across one that was

poisonous, I think, and...

Yeah, so he's like, you know, picking the mushrooms

and he hears a growl.

And he's like,

"Oh no, oh my gosh, what's out here?"

And then he turns around and it's a

hunter wolf.

'Cause all wolfs aren't hunters, I guess.

But this one in particular is.

And he's like,

"Oh my gosh, I'm scared.

"Go away."

(Ashley laughs)

That's not what he said.

He said,

"Get out of here.

"I have--"

Wait, no, the wolf...

When he saw the wolf, the wolf had a beak.

(Ashley laughs)

That definitely does not sound right.

Anyway, so yeah,

so Pumat was talking back to him and he's like...

(snorts)

(Ashley laughs)

Oh, I'm so sorry.

He's talking back to him and he's like,

"Hey, don't be mean to me.

"Don't you eat me because I'm Pumat Sol and..."

that night Pumat Sol down by the beautiful brook

in the forest area

that he was walking in, he was making food

and this beautiful food that he made, it was a stew

and with all the mushrooms that he made

and it had an interesting lupine taste.

(mellow music)

It was a dark, mysterious night in the forest

and Pumat Sol was wandering around collecting mushrooms,

odd mushrooms, poisonous mushrooms, some of them.

Strange mushrooms.

And as he was wandering around at night in the forest,

he was approached by a hunter wolf of some kind.

This wolf had a strange beak on his face.

And Pumat Sol, upon seeing this hunter wolf said,

"Hey now, you leave me alone and don't you eat me.

"You stay away.

"You stay away, you dangerous wolf."

And later that evening, after threatening this wolf,

Pumat Sol had himself a

very, very tasty stew

made with the mushrooms that he had collected

and the stew had an oddly lupine flavor there

in the dark woods by a brook.

It was a dark forest

in the middle of the night

in the dead of

winter--

I don't think that's right.

It was in the middle of the night.

And Pumat Sol was wandering through the forest

collecting mushrooms for a stew.

And suddenly,

he encroached upon a

hunter wolf with a beak.

So I don't know what that is.

Hunter wolf with a beak and

the wolf was

threatening him and Pumat Sol said,

"Hey you, don't you threaten me.

"That's not very nice."

And

then went on his merry way and later, by a wonderful stream

he made a nice stew with the mushrooms.

But this mushroom stew had an oddly lupine taste to it.

So,

we're watching you, Pumat Sol.

(playful music)

One night, it was a dark and

it's very important that it was a dark night.

Marisha was very emphatic about that.

And I believe it was winter.

Cold, snow on the ground

in a desolate forest.

Pumat Sol, our beloved friend, Pumat Sol was

just wandering about the forest at night

on a winter's night, as you do.

And he came upon--

oh shit.

Oh, he came upon a wolf who was just minding

his own business and Pumat Sol stumbled upon him and

frightened the wolf.

And the wolf became ill-tempered.

And it turns out that the wolf was

a hunter of some sort.

Maybe a disguise.

And Pumat Sol said,

"Oh, hey there, buddy.

"I don't want to make any trouble.

"I'm just out collecting...

"Collecting.

"Hunting for things."

What was he doing?

I've forgotten.

Anyway,

"Oh, don't worry about me, I'm innocent."

The wolf said,

"Eh, don't worry about it, keep going.

"Forget it ever happened."

Then--

oh, he was collecting mushrooms.

Pumat was collecting mushrooms and so he had

a bunch of mushrooms.

And I think the wolf looked up and down at the mushrooms

but sorta let it go.

Then later, when Pumat Sol got out of the forest,

he looked at the mushrooms and was very taken by them.

They were very curious mushrooms.

He decided to eat them.

And when he did, they had a very lupine flavor to them

and they changed things in Pumat Sol.

He became...

Well, something more.

It was a dark and cold

wintery night and

Pumat Sol was walking through the forest and

he was searching for mushrooms.

And he went and he found some and then

as he was

kept hunting for more mushrooms, he came upon a wolf.

And the wolf was like,

really angry that

Pumat met him and

then he was like,

"I'm just a hunter.

"I don't--

"You're fine, just keep going."

And Pumat Sol was like,

"Okay,"

and...

Yeah, and then Pumat Sol left and he

ate the mushrooms and

they had a very lupine flavor?

And,

Pumat Sol became something more.

It was a dark and

cold winter's evening

when Pumat Sol was walking through a forest.

As Pumat Sol walked through that cold, dark, wintery forest,

he came upon a wolf.

Wait.

First, Pumat Sol was looking for some mushrooms.

But then he came upon a wolf.

And the wolf came up and was angry to see Pumat Sol.

But the wolf was like,

"Hey, no bigs.

"I'm a hunter."

And Pumat Sol was like,

"Okay, sorry I ran into you."

And then the wolf left?

And then Pumat Sol continued his quest

to try and find some mushrooms.

And he found them.

And when he found them, they had a very

lupine flavor?

They tasted like a wolf.

And believe it or not, that's it.

(Travis laughs)

It was a dark

and scary night.

And cold.

And Pumat Sol was wandering through the forest.

(sniffs)

That was a signature Travis Willingham CEO sniff.

And he was alone in that dark, cold,

snowy now forest when he ran into a wolf

that he wasn't expecting.

And the wolf said,

"Hey."

And Pumat said,

"Hey, what are you doing here?"

And oh, but first, Pumat was here looking for shrooms.

And the wolf said,

"Hey, no bigs, my man.

"I'm a hunter."

And Pumat said,

"Okay."

And,

something happened.

I guess they parted ways.

But first, the wolf said,

"Here, try these mushrooms."

Maybe he was looking for them, maybe it was the wolf's idea.

I can't remember.

And then Pumat

sniffed the mushrooms and they were wolf-scented.

Like they sometimes are.

And that's the end of the story.

(dramatic piano music)

Mystery.

Hi everybody.

Hi.

Hi.

Hi.

Hi, guys.

How does everyone feel like they did?

Terrible.

Horrible.

(laughter)

I did all right with what I was given.

I feel like I did pretty good--

Facts were transmitted.

I think it got shorter and shorter

as it went along.

From what I understand, it got longer

but far less detailed.

(laughter)

I gotta fill some time here, I just gotta fill some time.

Well I felt so bad that Taliesin was after me.

I finished it and I feel like I couldn't even--

I was having such a hard time focusing and I was like,

"Okay, you need to remember everything,"

and then my mind just went blank.

(laughter)

I felt like...

Ashley, I felt like you were describing watching like,

a car accident happening at like

Dodger Stadium's parking lot.

I'm so sorry.

Wow, there was so much.

(laughter)

Ugh.

I was trying to remember like,

I followed Marisha and I felt like Marisha

only said three things.

And yet, I couldn't remember two of them.

(laughter)

I was vamping, I did a lot of vamping.

You were tipsy.

I told Travis you were tipsy in yours.

Were you drunk during your retelling?

I was a little bit drunk.

But you know, we've been locked away for weeks now

and so my wife and I have experimented

with cocktails every night.

You got to drink to live.

There was some good ones but, whew.

I did not, I was too scared.

Oh yeah.

I went after Taliesin and it's tough because

everything Taliesin says sounds like

some sort of deep and meaningful metaphor.

I was trying...

I came fresh off of Ashley's and I was trying to like...

I don't wanna say I was trying to fake Mercer back into it

but I was trying to do my best attempt

to put Matt back into the story.

Whose idea was it for me to go first?

I love it.

Was that the plan 'cause we all knew

that I would butcher it?

(laughter)

Kind of.

When I thought of the order, I kinda staggered people

based on like, their chaos meter.

I don't know if I'm insulted or complimented there.

I don't either, but I,

I'm fine with it.

That was the intent.

Well let's watch Matt's.

I think let's--

let's watch where it all started.

I'm the only one that got to see Matt's,

which is kind of neat.

All right.

Oh boy.

Everybody see that?

Yeah.

All right, here we go.

Twas chilled that foggy morning as enchanted Pumat

wandered the wood in search of fine mushrooms

to flavor his food.

He plucked a fine fungus when a guttural growl

caught his ears.

A feral wolf stalking from the shadows.

To his surprise, the beast did speak.

"'Tis I, the lonely wildred and you, my meal."

Pumat recoiled, reaching into his pouch of plenty.

"Well wandered I am, friend Wildred.

"I fear a poor meal would I make

"for this humble Pumat is tough on teeth

"and filled with muscle."

The simple fear bulg's bulging form took hold

of the hunter wolf and wrestled powerfully they did

across the trees and brooks

until an evening's mushroom stew

took on a unique, lupine flavor.

Oh!

A lot of color and character I do not recall.

Well that's my fault!

Because I dropped the whole entire conversation

that they had because I didn't remember any of it.

Ashley, I'm looking forward to see the number two

rendition more than anything because holy fuck,

it didn't sound anything like that.

I had the general...

Listening to Matt's I was like,

"Okay, I have the summary of it."

There just was no dialogue.

There's a few details that you threw in that definitely

I was like--

That's definitely no there.

And I was like huh.

I don't know where I added that.

Laura cam probably--

Laura was after me.

I inserted dialogue back in.

He did.

Sam gave dialogue...

I forgot that I was supposed to tell the story

and I literally like, here's the facts.

(laughter)

Standby, guys, sorry about that.

I guess so.

Wait, we were supposed

to tell a story?

Wait, I wanna see

all the rest of them without having to screen share.

I think I added a poison mushroom.

You did.

And what's funny is I still got a little of the Ashley.

So when I retold my story, it definitely had the like,

"Yo, you get outta here."

It did?

I didn't know I did--

I don't remember what I did.

I didn't look, I sent it off right away

'cause I was mortified.

Oh, I didn't watch mine either.

I was just send it off as quickly as humanly possible.

Yep.

I was so close--

I wanted it out.

To rerecording it and

trying to really remember the story and make it better

than what I did--

You got one round, though.

And then I was like,

"That's not the rules."

No the rule is one round.

And it has to be like this.

(laughter)

Things just have to be this way.

Oh God.

And I knew Sam was gonna just make up his own thing.

Well I was given...

I mean, Marisha, you did a great job.

But it was a little short on details.

It was just like, it was the broad strokes,

it was just like,

there was a wolf, there was a Pumat,

there was some mushrooms.

And then that's it.

I was like,

"Oh boy, that doesn't feel like a story.

"I should probably insert some--"

Oh boy, more vodka in my martini.

(laughter)

Oh my God.

Oh man, oh man.

Everybody see that?

Yeah.

All right, here we go.

(Liam sighs)

Okay, my turn.

(grunts)

No pressure, bring it on.

It was a dark and scary night

and cold.

And Pumat Sol was wandering through the forest.

(sniffs)

That was a signature Travis Willingham CEO sniff.

(laughter)

And he was alone in that dark, cold

snowy now forest when he ran into a wolf

that he wasn't expecting.

And the wolf said,

"Hey."

And Pumat said,

"Hey, what are you doing here?"

And oh, but first,

Pumat was here looking for shrooms.

And the wolf said,

"Hey, no bigs, my man.

"I'm a hunter."

And Pumat said,

"Okay."

And,

something happened.

I guess they parted ways and--

but first, the wolf said,

"Here, try these mushrooms."

Maybe he was looking for them, maybe it was the wolf's idea.

I can't remember.

And then Pumat sniffed the mushrooms

and they were wolf-scented.

(laughter)

Like they sometimes are.

And that's the end of the story.

(laughter)

Mystery.

(laughter)

Perfect.

Nailed it.

You know what?

It's not that far off, guys.

It's really not.

No, it's not terrible.

It's really not.

If we do this again, are we--

if we do this again, we should have--

we should try a longer, even a longer one

just to see how far off it can get.

I think I have a feeling that probably

when I somehow thought there was

a poisonous mushroom in there

that that's where the sort of shrooming took off.

I wanna see Ashley's so bad.

It's two minutes, Ashley Johnson!

Two minutes?

No, I thought it was like 30 seconds?

No.

(Marisha laughs)

What took you a minute and 52 to say.

You guys are in for something.

It was so good.

I was thought it was 30 seconds.

Just wanna double check, can you guys hear it?

Yeah, all right here we go.

Okay so

twas a great and just beautiful night out in

the woods and

Pumat was just out walking around, his normal nightly stroll

and trying to get some mushrooms.

He came across one that was poisonous

I think?

And yeah, so he's like, you know, picking the mushrooms

and he hears a growl.

And he's like,

"Oh no, oh my gosh, what's out here?"

And then he turns around and it's a

hunter wolf.

And...

'Cause all wolfs aren't hunters, I guess.

But this one in particular is.

And he's like,

"Oh my gosh, I'm scared.

"Go away."

That's not what he said.

He said,

"Get out of here, I have..."

Wait, no, the wolf,

when he saw the wolf, the wolf had a beak.

What the fuck?

That definitely does not sound right.

Anyway, so yeah.

So Pumat was talking back to him and he's like

(snorts)

(Ashley laughs)

Oh, I'm so sorry.

He's talking back to him and he's like,

"Hey, don't be mean to me.

"Don't you eat me because I'm Pumat Sol."

And that night, Pumat Sol down by the beautiful brook

in the forest area that he was walking in,

he was making food, and this beautiful food that he made,

it was a stew.

And with all the mushrooms that he made and it had

an interesting lupine taste

in the stew.

Great story.

(laughter)

What's the beak thing?

Was there a beak anywhere in there?

No!

No, no beak.

Where the fuck did the beak come from?

What are you--

what?

I'm dying.

The beak made it through to me.

I described a hunter wolf with a beak.

I missed that.

It was just a regular wolf, yeah?

A hunter wolf.

I was thinking,

"Is it a wolf hunter that he met?

"I don't know."

I was almost at the edge of saying like a wolf hunter.

Ready.

Okay here goes.

It was a dark, mysterious night in the forest

and Pumat Sol was wandering around collecting mushrooms.

Odd mushrooms, poisonous mushrooms

some of them, strange mushrooms.

And as he was wandering around at night in the forest,

he was approached by a hunter wolf of some kind.

This wolf had a strange beak

on his face.

Pumat Sol, upon seeing this hunter wolf said,

"Hey, now you leave me alone and don't you eat me.

"You stay away.

"You stay away, you dangerous wolf."

And later that evening, after threatening this wolf,

Pumat Sol had himself

a very, very tasty stew

made with the mushrooms that he had collected.

And the stew had an oddly lupine flavor there

in the dark woods by a brook.

(laughs)

Remember the brook at the end.

I'm so sorry, good luck.

That was pretty good.

It had a haunted Rod Sterling vibe.

That was good.

That was told with such confidence.

That was basically everything that I said.

In a weird order.

I love how you made Pumat everyone's favorite uncle

trying to--

now you don't eat me.

Now you...

She was like,

"He said something, I don't know what."

I was like,

"What would Pumat Sol say?

"I don't know."

You put a lot of good dialogue back in there though.

You put a lot of that Mercer dialogue back in there.

I was trying to Mercer really hard.

Oh.

Oh, hello.

I put on makeup, guys.

Okay, so it was a dark forest

in the middle of the night

in the dead of

winter, I don't think that's right.

It was the middle of the night and Pumat Sol

was wandering through the forest collecting mushrooms

for a stew and

suddenly, he encroached upon a

hunter wolf with a beak.

So,

I don't know what that is.

A hunter wolf with a beak and

the wolf was

threatening him and Pumat Sol said,

"Hey, you.

"Don't you threaten me.

"That's not very nice."

And,

then went on his merry way.

And later, by a wonderful stream, he made a nice stew

with the mushrooms.

But this mushroom stew had an oddly lupine taste to it.

So,

we're watching you, Pumat Sol.

That was good.

Good luck, Sam.

(laughter)

It's interesting the things we all picked out.

We all picked out the same things that stood out.

Look how drunk.

I hope Sam stays this close.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

Here's the story.

I'm a little bit tipsy so we'll see how this goes.

One night, it was a dark and

it's very important that it's a dark night.

Marisha was very emphatic about that

and I believe it was winter.

Cold, snow on the ground

in a desolate forest.

Pumat Sol, our beloved friend, Pumat Sol

was just wandering about the forest at night

on a winter's night, as you do.

And he came upon...

Oh shit.

Oh, he came upon a wolf, who was just minding

his own business and Pumat Sol stumbled upon him and

frightened the wolf.

And the wolf became ill-tempered.

And it turns out that the wolf was

a hunter of some sort.

Maybe a disguise.

And Pumat Sol said,

"Oh, hey there buddy.

"I don't want to make any trouble, I'm just out

"collecting..."

Collecting.

Hunting for things.

What was he doing?

I've forgotten.

Anyway.

"Oh, don't worry about me.

"I'm innocent."

The wolf said,

"Eh, don't worry about it, just keep going.

"Forget it ever happened."

Then--

oh, he was collecting mushrooms.

Pumat was collecting mushrooms and so he had

a bunch of mushrooms.

And I think the wolf looked up and down

at the mushrooms but sorta let it go.

Then later, when Pumat Sol got out of the forest,

he looked at the mushrooms and was very taken by them.

They were very curious mushrooms.

He decided to eat them.

And when he did, they had a very lupine flavor to them.

And they had changed things in Pumat Sol.

He became

well, something more.

(laughter)

Yes.

That was a whole other story,

that was a whole other story.

That was a whole other story, that's amazing.

I dig it.

You bid the beak adieu.

Oh, here we go.

(wooing)

Also glam.

Okay.

I already forget everything.

Okay.

It was a dark and

cold, wintery night and

Pumat Sol was walking through the forest and

he was searching for mushrooms.

And he went and he found some and then

as he was

kept hunting for more mushrooms, he came upon

a wolf and the wolf was like

really angry that

Pumat met him and

then he was like,

"I'm just, I'm just a hunter.

"I don't--

"You're fine, just keep going."

(laughter)

And Pumat Sol was like,

"Okay."

Yeah and then Pumat Sol left and he

ate the mushrooms and

they had a very lupine flavor?

And,

Pumat Sol became

something more.

(laughter)

That's pretty good.

All the facts were there, all the facts were there.

You know what I'm learning about us--

All the facts were there.

We are really good listeners.

All the dialogue, of all the improvised Pumat dialogue,

all that Pumat said in your story was,

"Okay."

(laughter)

Okay, you weirdos.

My wife did an interesting job.

Here we go.

It was a dark and

cold winter's evening

when Pumat Sol was walking through a forest.

As Pumat Sol walked through that cold, dark, wintery forest

he came upon a wolf.

Wait, first, Pumat Sol was looking for some mushrooms

but then he came upon a wolf.

And the wolf came up and was angry

to see Pumat Sol but the wolf was like,

"Hey, no bigs.

"I'm a hunter."

And Pumat Sol was like,

"Okay, sorry I ran into you."

And then the wolf

left?

And then Pumat Sol continued his quest

to try and find some mushrooms and he found them.

And when he found them, they had a very

lupine flavor.

They tasted like a wolf.

And believe it or not, that's it.

(laughter)

Good luck.

(laughter)

Oh my God.

Oh my God.

I just choked on my spit.

We have to do a long one.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

This was the test.

This was the test.

I still don't remember, I don't remember

why Matt said they did.

Do they?

He killed the wolf.

He killed the wolf?

He killed the wolf and--

the story was eluding that at the end,

he made a stew that tasted like the wolf

'cause he killed the wolf and ate him.

He killed the wolf and ate the wolf with mushrooms.

I love with Sam, Sam just edited out

any type of conflict.

So it meant for the last two people they were like,

"And I guess like, they just left?"

(laughter)

I guess that's it.

You know, the key to telling a good story is no conflict.

(laughter)

(mellow music)
